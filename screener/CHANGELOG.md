# Changelog

All notable changes to Screener are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-25

### Changed
- **Confirm-dialog accessibility** (`dialog.js`): the modal is now a labelled
  dialog, moves focus into itself on open and restores it on close, and traps Tab
  focus between its buttons.

### Fixed
- **Full-page capture truncation is now honest:** when the tile budget or the
  canvas-height ceiling can't reach the bottom of a very tall page, the result is
  flagged truncated (and tiles the canvas can't hold are no longer captured),
  instead of silently dropping content.

### Hardened
- **Backup import** rejects a file whose `schema` is newer than this build
  understands, instead of silently mis-restoring it.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-25

### Changed
- Deleting a comment pin now asks for confirmation first.

### Fixed
- Hardening pass: the visible-area capture validates the tab and handles a
  failed capture (closed tab, non-capturable page, revoked permission) instead
  of throwing; undo/redo survives a corrupted history entry; and the ticket
  description field is capped at 2000 characters.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Backup & restore** in Options → Settings: export all your settings to a JSON
  file, or import one to restore them on another machine. Imports are confirmed
  first and replace what is currently on the device. (Transient captures are not
  part of the backup.)

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- Options → Tickets "What gets sent": restored the inline `code` styling on the
  field/format names (`multipart/form-data`, `title`, `screenshot`, etc.) that
  was lost when the paragraph was localized, while keeping the prose translatable.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Numbered comment pins** — a new annotation tool: click to drop numbered
  pins (blue/white) on the capture, add an editable comment in a floating card,
  hover to preview, and pins renumber 1..N when one is removed. On export, a
  numbered legend of the comments is appended beneath the image.
- **Firefox support** — a `firefox` build target (`node build.mjs firefox
  screener`); full-screen capture is off there (no offscreen API), like Safari.
- Icons on the editor's Copy / Submit ticket / Download buttons.

### Changed
- README and privacy docs updated for the comment pins and the opt-in Sync.
- Localized the Tickets-tab copy.

### Fixed
- Renamed a shadowed `t` (i18n) binding in the annotator/editor.
- Packaging file list now includes `sync.js` and `build-config.js`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Sync across devices** (opt-in) — a Settings toggle keeps your ticket
  endpoint and token in sync via the browser's account sync. Off by default.
- **Tickets options tab** — the endpoint/token settings and the "What gets
  sent" note now live on their own tab, each in a card.

### Changed
- The editor hides the **Submit ticket** button until a ticket endpoint is
  configured (Download and Copy still work); it appears live once one is set.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Photo-realistic camera icon** — graphite gradient body, brushed-metal
  lens barrel, and a blue glass lens, filling the canvas edge-to-edge.
- **Internationalization** — English (US) baseline via `_locales`.
- **Safari-aware build** — the multi-target build gates `offscreen` and
  `downloads` so the same source ships to Chrome and Safari.
- **Tabbed options page** — Settings / About, with a sticky header (logo +
  title left; theme toggle and Close right).
- **Close button** on the editor and on the options page.
- Extension icon shown to the left of the title in every window.

### Changed
- Editor: zoom/pan, pixelate redaction, a capture keyboard shortcut, and
  saved capture defaults.

### Fixed
- Audit hardening — safer downloads, error surfacing, and orphaned-capture
  cleanup.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added
- Initial release: screen capture, annotation, clipboard copy, ticket
  submission, and an options page.
